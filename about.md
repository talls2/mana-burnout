This is a blog about tech, work and everything in-between

My name is Victor and I'm a developer who works with web technologies. I like building things and I'm studying and transitioning to lower level languages and game development, I will use this blog to document my journey and write about just anything I think is fun.

This blog is not just for me, if you wish to write here too, send a PR to <https://github.com/victormamede/mana-burnout>, you just need to create a markdown file inside the `_posts` directory and you information in the `_data/authors` directory.

Also, this blog is based on the [Scriptor Theme for Jekyll](https://github.com/JustGoodThemes/Scriptor-Jekyll-Theme), which is MIT, so feel free to clone this repo as well if you wish.

*Thank You for reading!*
